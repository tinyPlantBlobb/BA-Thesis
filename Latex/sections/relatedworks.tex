Simmilar works have been done for ASR with \cite{8683086} as they also take a look at uncertainty quantification wiht the help of dropout. 

\cite{negri-etal-2014-quality} take look at black box asr QE but have a small amount of white box qe

\cite{le2016automatic} which is a supervised approach that classifies on a word basis rather than a segement basis

other works that have looked at QE are \cite{dinh2023perturbationbasedqeexplainableunsupervised} which looks at black box text qe

the IWSLT has a track for QE
