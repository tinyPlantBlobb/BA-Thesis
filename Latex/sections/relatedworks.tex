\cite{fomicheva2020unsupervised} is the basis of this approach
Simmilar works have been done for ASR with \cite{8683086} as they also take a look at uncertainty quantification wiht the help of dropout. 

\cite{negri-etal-2014-quality} take look at black box asr QE but have a small amount of white box qe

and on a full scale by 
Le et al. \cite{le2016automatic} do similar work as this thesis but they use a supervised approach that classifies on a word basis rather than a segement basis and the translation step of the cascaded model is a statiscitcal machine translation model instead of a neural model. 

other works that have looked at QE are \cite{dinh2023perturbationbasedqeexplainableunsupervised} which looks at black box text q

the IWSLT has a track for QE and one for spoken language translation
