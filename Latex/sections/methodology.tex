- take values from model to estimate quality (normal mode) for transctiption and transltation 
- to get the model values, aka probabilies at each decoding step the models return them during generation, hence why open source models, like Whisper, seamless and deltalm were used

- run model with dropout several times and get the same values each run 
- summ over those values and take the average of those values as qe 
- do this for transcription and translation 


- for a single score in cascaded models: add/multiply the values together if need be with weights
