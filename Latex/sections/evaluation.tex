\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{ch:Evaluation}
The evaluation of results of the experiments that were concucted on the benchmark section of the IWSLT 2023 dataset \cite{sperber2024evaluating} with regards to \ref{ch:Dataset}

pearson correlate \cite{2020SciPy-NMeth} the results to comet scores and compare those

\section{Transctiption evaluation}


using WER, proposed in \cite{woodard1982} and \cite{morris2004}, as reference score to compare the transctiption quality estimation metric by correlating the wer scores with the help of the pearsoncorrelation \cite{2020SciPy-NMeth}
As WER is case sensitive, both the model result and the reference are normalised to be all lowercase, as the capialisation should have no effect on the quality of the the transcription
\todo{add plot with model and reference prob plotted, expand}
\section{Translation evaluation}

generate reference score with the help of comet \cite{rei-etal-2020-comet} which means that a score close to 1 is a good translation and a score close to 0 is a bad translation that is no better than random chance.
those reference scores are then also pearson correlated with the scores from the model. 
\todo{add plot, expand, compare results from seamless to dlm and the end to end scores}

\section{Dropout evaluation}

\todo{add text, explain results, compare them, add plot}

\section{One unified score}
since several different metrics are used in the translation part of the cascaded model it is interesting which one might be the best choice to use in a unified score, from the text translation paper \cite{fomicheva2020unsupervised} we can gather that different metrics work better for different language groups, as this thesis only tested on english to german translation no definite choice can be made but

\todo{expand, add full judgement}
