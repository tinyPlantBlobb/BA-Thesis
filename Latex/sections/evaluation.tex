\section{Transcription evaluation}

using WER\ref{wer}, proposed in \cite{woodard1982} and \cite{morris2004}, as reference score to compare the transctiption quality estimation metric by correlating the wer scores with the help of the pearsoncorrelation \cite{2020SciPy-NMeth}
As WER is case sensitive, both the model result and the reference are normalised to be all lowercase, as the capialisation should have no effect on the quality of the the transcription

\end{figure}

\section{Translation evaluation}

generate reference score with the help of comet \cite{rei-etal-2020-comet} which means that a score close to 1 is a good translation and a score close to 0 is a bad translation that is no better than random chance.
those reference scores are then also pearson correlated with the scores from the model.

\end{figure}
\todo{add (scatter)plot, expand, compare results from seamless to dlm and the end to end scores}

\section{Dropout evaluation}
the dropout score is calculated by taking the mean of the dropout probabilities of the model, the variance of the dropout probabilities and a combination of both, the dropout score is then pearson correlated with the comet scores or the word error scores in the case of the transctiption. 
for this the dropout probabilities are calculated by running the model 30 times with the dropout layer enabled and then taking the mean and variance of the resulting probabilities.

\section{One unified score}
since several different metrics are used in the translation part of the cascaded model it is interesting which one might be the best choice to use in a unified score, from the text translation paper \cite{fomicheva2020unsupervised} we can gather that different metrics work better for different language groups, as this thesis only tested on english to german translation no definite choice can be made but

\todo{expand, add full judgement}
for a unified score the baselines, which are the tranlsation and transcription probability, are multiplied
but considering the results it might be better to use \todo{fill out}
